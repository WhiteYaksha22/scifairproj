    <h1>Poking at the ineffable</h1>
    <p>We will make a website where all useful information on black holes are being
        aggregated together by relevant staff. Black holes are enigmatic bodies that drift
        aimlessly in space, nefarious for being gluttonous monsters which not even light could
        escape. A lot of people find black holes endlessly interesting, and it is our wish to collect
        and display all relevant information to black holes in systemized categories so that people
        may find it easier to discover more on them for their own purposes.</p>
